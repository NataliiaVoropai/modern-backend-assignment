Hello! My name is *Natalia Voropai*. I am looking forward to the start of the course. 
Here's my suggestion of a small CLI weather tool. 

Tool | Purpose
--- | ---
PyTest documentation | Checked how to run tests locally
ChatGPT | Consulted to refresh some things 
www.weatherapi.com | Checked documentation for the endpoints and fields I need

Thank you for attention!
