Hello! My name is **Natalia Voropai**. I am looking forward to the start of the course. 
Here's my suggestion of a small CLI weather tool. 
See how it works: https://www.loom.com/share/97359cf0252b4ac39a4d44ff274312f6?sid=c66bf231-907f-4f6c-8e00-adc6ec7f6f45

Tool | Purpose
--- | ---
PyTest documentation | Checked how to run tests locally
ChatGPT | Consulted to refresh some things 
www.weatherapi.com | Checked documentation for the endpoints and fields I need

Thank you for attention!
